#Battleship Earth Simulator#

The universe has changed.  Galaxies have died, suns have exploded.  Our sun is the last one standing.  In response to the dying universe, planets have broken their orbit and are being drawn to our sun, no matter the distance.  These planets are adapting so their inhabitants can survive.  Unfortunately for earth these planets all want our position in the suns orbit.  Your earth has begun to build weapons to destroy these rouge infringing planets.  Now it's your mission to keep it alive.  How many years can you survive?

#How to Play#

Starting off you will recieve a random planet.  Other random planets will come to attack. Control your fire, water, air and health regeneration through the planet options by adjusting your population allocations.  The higher the population you have the better your regeneration will be.  After winning a fight you will have three choices: Destroy, Peace, Takeover. 

Destroying your enemy, will leave behind a random weapon with 1 health for your arsenal. You will not know what weapon your enemy has left behind until it's in a weapon slot. If you have no open weapon slots, you will be asked to replace one of your current weapons.  Choose wisely or leave your new weapon behind.

Declare peace with your enemy and leave them alone to move on.  Doing so will allow some of their popluation to defect over to your planet.  The more people you have, the better your regeneration rates and ability to allocate people to different resources.

Finally takeover, leave your planet, weapons, and people behind. Nothing from your old planet will come along except yourself. You will takeover your enemies planet in it's entirety as your own.  Beware, you will only have half life to begin since you just decimated this new planet.
Good luck!
